# Expense Splitter

The Expense Splitter is a simple and practical project designed to help users **divide expenses among multiple people**. The main goal of this project is to make it easy to calculate how much each person needs to pay when a group spends money together.

The user first enters the **number of people involved** in the expense. After that, they can add multiple expenses to an expense list, such as food, travel, shopping, or any shared cost. The program then calculates the total expense and splits it equally among all participants.

This project demonstrates how real-world problems can be solved using programming logic, making it a useful mini-project for beginners who want to build practical applications.
