# Personal Finance Tracker

The Personal Finance Tracker is a simple budgeting project that helps users manage their income and expenses in an organized way. The main goal of this project is to show how programming can be used to track personal finances and calculate savings or remaining balance.

The user enters their monthly income and predefined expenses such as rent, food, transport, and savings. After entering the values, the user can click the Calculate button to compute the total expenses and determine how much money is left after expenses are deducted from the income.

The project also includes a Reset button that clears all input fields and results, allowing the user to start a fresh calculation. The output section displays the total expenses, the remaining balance, and a message indicating whether the user is saving money or overspending.

This project demonstrates how basic financial logic can be implemented in a simple and interactive program.
