# Prime Number Finder – Project Description

The **Prime Number Finder** is a simple Python **GUI project** that allows users to find all prime numbers within a given range. The main purpose of this project is to help learners understand number **logic**, **loops**, and **input handling** in an interactive way.

The user enters a **starting number** and an **ending number** in the input fields. After clicking the `Find Prime Numbers` button, the program **checks each number in the range** and **displays all prime numbers** on the screen. This makes it easy to visualize how prime numbers are calculated programmatically.

The project also includes exception handling to manage invalid inputs, such as empty fields or non-numeric values. This ensures the program does not crash and provides user-friendly error messages instead.

Overall, this project is a great example of combining mathematical logic with a graphical user interface, making learning Python more interactive and practical.

## Concepts Learned from Prime Number Finder

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Creating a GUI app using a class-based structure.

- **Python GUI Development** – Building interfaces with CustomTkinter.

- **Prime Number Algorithm** – Checking prime numbers using - **mathematical logic and loops.

- **Mathematical Optimization** – Using sqrt(n) to reduce prime-checking iterations.

- **User Input Handling** – Getting and processing values from entry fields.

- **Input Validation** – Ensuring valid ranges and positive numbers.

- **Exception Handling** – Using try–except blocks and message boxes for errors.

- **List Comprehension** – Generating prime numbers efficiently in a range.

- **Event Handling** – Running logic when the “Find Prime Numbers” button is clicked.

- **GUI Layout Management** – Using grid and frames for structured UI design.
