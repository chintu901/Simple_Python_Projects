# Grade Calculator

The Grade Calculator is a simple academic utility project that helps users calculate their total marks, grades, and final result based on multiple subjects. This project is designed to simulate a real student grading system in an interactive and user-friendly way.

The user can enter the subject name and marks obtained using two input fields. Each subject entry is added to a list and displayed on the screen as a card. Every card includes a Remove button, allowing users to delete any subject if they make a mistake or want to update their data.

The program automatically calculates the total marks obtained, determines the grade, checks whether the student has passed or failed, and shows the number of subjects entered. This makes the project useful for understanding how data collection and calculations work in real-world applications.
