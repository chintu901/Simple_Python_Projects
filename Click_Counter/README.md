# Click Counter

The **Click Counter** is a simple interactive project designed to demonstrate how user actions can dynamically update data on the screen. The main idea of this project is to track how many times a user clicks `Click Me!!` button and display that count in real time.

When the user clicks the `Click Me!!` button, the application increases the counter by one and immediately updates the message on the screen.

## Key Features:
- A button that increases the click count on each press.
- Real-time display of the total number of clicks.
- A reset button to set the counter back to zero.
